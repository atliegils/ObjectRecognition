https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

Steps 2 and 3 are optional!

2) Add images to the folder fruits like this:
~..\dataset\FolderName\ImageName.jpg

3) Run the script to retrain the network:
    python retrain.py
    
4) Run this script for a selected image in the test folder
    python classify.py
    
5) Change the "graph" parameters in classify.py to try out differently trained graphs
